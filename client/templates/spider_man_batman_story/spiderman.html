		<p>Following the release of 2007's <i>Spider-Man 3</i>, Sony Pictures did not know what to do with their most profitable property. 2001's <i>Spider-Man</i> and 2004's <i>Spider-Man 2</i> were massive critical and box-office successes. To this day they are widely credited with re-popularizing the superhero blockbuster. Spider-Man 3 was another box-office success, but was almost universally disliked by everyone. By the time Sony got around to pre-production on Spider-Man 4, <i>The Dark Knight</i> and <i>Iron-Man</i> had dominated the summer of 2008. Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire's version of Spider-Man had neither the mature appeal of The Dark Knight, nor the shared-cinematic experience that Iron-Man it's upcoming Avenger companion films had. Spider-Man was feeling dated, and talent around the character was getting more expensive and bloated with each new release. Sony had also just produced the hit James Bond reboot <i>Casino Royale</i>, which proved to them that they had the chops to reinvigorate a beloved character. In 2010, Sony Pictures announced that they would not be going forward with <i>Spider-Man 4</i>, in favor of a "dark and gritty reboot" to launch in 2012.</p>
