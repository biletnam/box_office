		<p>Following the release of 2007's <i>Spider-Man 3</i>, Sony Pictures did not know what to do with their most profitable property. 2001's <i>Spider-Man</i> and 2004's <i>Spider-Man 2</i> were massive critical and box-office successes. To this day they are widely credited with re-popularizing the superhero blockbuster. Spider-Man 3 was another box-office success, but was almost universally disliked by everyone. By the time Sony got around to pre-production on Spider-Man 4, <i>The Dark Knight</i> and <i>Iron-Man</i> had dominated the summer of 2008. Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire's version of Spider-Man had neither the mature appeal of The Dark Knight, nor the shared-cinematic experience that Iron-Man it's upcoming Avenger companion films had. Spider-Man was feeling dated, and talent around the character was getting more expensive and bloated with each new release. Sony had also just produced the hit James Bond reboot <i>Casino Royale</i>, which proved to them that they had the chops to reinvigorate a beloved character. In 2010, Sony Pictures announced that they would not be going forward with <i>Spider-Man 4</i>, in favor of a "dark and gritty reboot" to launch in 2012.</p>

		<p>When <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> was released in 2012, it was met with <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_amazing_spider_man/?search=spider-man">modest critical approval</a> and was a minor box-office success. The consensus around the film was that although a new director and cast was refreshing, the dark and gritty tone didn't really gel with the Spider-Man character. On top of that, viewers were annoyed that they had to sit through another Spider-Man origin story. Nevertheless, Sony had faith that <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> was a successful building block that would lead to more successful sequels. Perhaps over-confidently, Sony greenlit <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i> for 2014, <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 3</i> for 2016, and <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 4</i> for 2018</p>

		<p>For <i>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</i>, Sony Pictures decided to drop the panned "dark and gritty" angle in favor of a more light-hearted take. Unfortunately, Sony also stuffed the film with too many plotlines and characters, which was suprising due to the fact that this was the main aspect that was criticized in <i>Spider-Man 3</i> seven years prior. This caused the film to be an incoherent mess, that viewers complained was more of set-up for sequels and spin-offs than its own movie. It would become both the lowest grossing and the <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_amazing_spider_man_2/">worst reviewed Spider-Man film</a> in the franchise. The negative reception of the film eventually lead Sony to cancel all upcoming sequels and spin-offs for the franchise. Sony would eventually work out a deal with Marvel Studios, in which Marvel would take over creative control of the character. Predictably, Marvel opted to reboot the franchise and incorporate the "new" Spider-Man into their cinematic universe. On another note, Batman is seeing another reboot as well, with the release of <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</i></p>
